      Depending on which Health Plan you choose, you’ll save money on things
      like annual vaccinations, flea and worm treatment and routine health
      check-ups. To help you, we'll send you handy reminders and with most
      plans, you can spread the cost across the year. They really are the easy
      way to protect your pet.
